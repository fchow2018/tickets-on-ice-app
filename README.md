# User Stories

A hard working father, aged 45, wants to take his family to a hockey game. He open the Frozen Tickets app and sign up. Once he signs up, he can choose which game he wants to buy tickets for. If he can’t find the game he wants to go to on the landing page, he can use the search box or use the drop down to filter to their team. He will then tap the “GET TICKETS” button. On the next page, he can choose the number of tickets he wants to buy and adjust the ticket prices to their budget. He taps on the section and row he and his family want to sit in. His order information is displayed on the following page. When he taps “GET TICKETS” again, the ticket purchasing process continues with the option of mobile ticketing. Upon tapping “CHECKOUT”, he will input their payment and billing info and place his order. If he selects “Mobile Ordering”, he will see their ticket under the “Tickets” page. If he did not, the ticket will be emailed to him for printing.
